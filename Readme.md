### The distribution chart of pb (price-to-book ratio) of listed companies since 2008
The code provided is designed to retrieve and analyze the PB50 (Price-to-Book ratio at the 50th percentile) data for a range of stocks within a specified time period using the JQData platform.

First, the necessary libraries, including numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib.pyplot for plotting, pandas for data manipulation, and jqdata for accessing financial data, are imported.

Next, the code fetches a list of trade days between '2008-01-01' and '2023-05-01' using the get_trade_days function from JQData.

To store the PB50 data, a new DataFrame named pb50_data is created, with columns for 'date' and 'pb50'.

The code then retrieves all the stock codes using the get_all_securities function from JQData and filters for stocks.

A loop is then executed, iterating over each trade day in the trade_days list.

For each trade day, the code retrieves the PB ratio fundamentals data for all stocks using the get_fundamentals function from JQData and filters for the stock list obtained earlier.

The PB50 value is calculated by taking the 50th percentile (median) of the PB ratio data obtained.

The date and corresponding PB50 value are appended to the pb50_data DataFrame.

Finally, the pb50_data DataFrame is sorted by date in ascending order, and the PB50 values over time are plotted using matplotlib.pyplot. The resulting plot provides a visual representation of the changes in PB50 values for the selected stocks within the specified time range.


### Total revenue of all listed companies from 2016-2022

The provided code retrieves the operating revenue data for all stocks listed in the JQData platform and calculates the total operating revenue from the year 2016 to the year 2022. It begins by obtaining the stock codes using the get_all_securities function and creates an empty DataFrame to store the dataset. The code then iterates through each stock code and queries the operating revenue for each company during the specified year. If the data is available, it is appended to the main DataFrame. Finally, the code calculates the sum of the operating revenue by accessing the 'operating_revenue' column of the DataFrame and prints the result. This code allows for a comprehensive analysis of the total operating revenue generated by various companies, providing valuable insights into the overall financial performance from 2016-2022


### Total revenue of all listed companies by industry in 2022

The provided code retrieves the operating revenue data for companies within various industries using the JQData platform. It begins by obtaining a list of industries using the get_industries function, filtering for Level 1 and 2 industries.

An empty DataFrame called df_total is created to store the dataset, and two empty lists are initialized to store industry names and corresponding revenues.

The code then loops through each industry in the obtained list. For each industry, it retrieves the name and all the stocks within that industry using the get_industry_stocks function.

Within the nested loop, the code iterates through each stock in the current industry. It constructs a query to fetch the operating revenue for each company, specifically for the year 2022.

If the retrieved DataFrame, df, is not empty, the code adds the industry information by assigning the industry name to a new column called 'sw_l1'. The data is then appended to the df_total DataFrame using pd.concat.

After iterating through all industries and companies, the code calculates the sum of the operating revenue for each industry by grouping the data based on the 'sw_l1' column and applying the sum function.

A new DataFrame, industry_df, is created to store the industry names and their corresponding revenue. It consists of two columns, 'Name' for the industry names and 'Revenue' for the summed operating revenue.

The industry_df DataFrame is sorted in descending order based on the 'Revenue' column using the sort_values function, and the index is reset to create a continuous range of integers.

Finally, the sorted DataFrame, industry_df_sorted, is printed, providing a comprehensive overview of the industries and their respective revenues, allowing for an analysis of the revenue distribution among different sectors.


### company median pb ratio weekly diatribution chart(2008-2020  2011-2015  2016-2010  2021-2023)

The provided Python code showcases a comprehensive data analysis and visualization process for the median PB50 
values of listed stocks from 2008 to 2023, organized into four distinct periods: 2008-2010, 2011-2014, 2015-2018, and 2019-2023. Using the "joinquant" platform and Python's data manipulation (NumPy, Pandas) and visualization (Matplotlib) libraries, the analysis begins by acquiring all trade days within the specified timeframe and filtering to include only Mondays. Then, the PB ratio data for all listed stocks is retrieved, and the median PB50 values are calculated for each trade week. Through captivating visualizations, the trends in PB50 ratios over time are depicted. Additionally, the code plots the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) to show the cumulative probability distribution of PB50 values and the probability density function (PDF) for a deeper understanding of the valuation distribution. This impressive data-driven approach highlights strong data analysis skills and serves as an invaluable resource for potential investment decision-making and partnership opportunities.

### pb ps median distribution for first level industries in joinquant

The provided Python code demonstrates a comprehensive data analysis and visualization process for six different industries from 2008 to 2023. The industries include "采掘" (Mining) and the code calculates and visualizes the median PB (Price-to-Book) and PS (Price-to-Sales) ratios for each industry, showcasing key valuation insights over time.
The process begins by defining the industry code for "采掘" (Mining) and setting the time range from January 1, 2008, to April 30, 2023. The code then retrieves the trade days and filters them to include only Mondays, creating a list of trade weeks. A DataFrame is created to store the PB50 (median PB ratio) data.
The code iterates over each trade week and, for each week, retrieves the PB ratio data for the stocks within the "mining" industry. It then calculates the median PB ratio for that week and appends the date and PB50 value to the DataFrame. The same process is repeated for the PS (Price-to-Sales) ratio, creating a DataFrame to store the PS data.
After eliminating any missing values, the code plots the PB50 and PS median distribution graphs for the "mining" industry, showing how the valuation metrics change over the specified time period. This process is then repeated for the other five industries.
The code showcases advanced data manipulation using Python's Pandas library and data visualization using Matplotlib. The resulting visualizations provide valuable insights into the valuation trends of the six industries, making it a valuable resource for investment decision-making and potential partnerships within the financial industry.
