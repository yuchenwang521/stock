2008 listed company median pb ratio diatribution chart

The code provided is designed to retrieve and analyze the PB50 (Price-to-Book ratio at the 50th percentile) data for a range of stocks within a specified time period using the JQData platform.

First, the necessary libraries, including numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib.pyplot for plotting, pandas for data manipulation, and jqdata for accessing financial data, are imported.

Next, the code fetches a list of trade days between '2008-01-01' and '2023-05-01' using the get_trade_days function from JQData.

To store the PB50 data, a new DataFrame named pb50_data is created, with columns for 'date' and 'pb50'.

The code then retrieves all the stock codes using the get_all_securities function from JQData and filters for stocks.

A loop is then executed, iterating over each trade day in the trade_days list.

For each trade day, the code retrieves the PB ratio fundamentals data for all stocks using the get_fundamentals function from JQData and filters for the stock list obtained earlier.

The PB50 value is calculated by taking the 50th percentile (median) of the PB ratio data obtained.

The date and corresponding PB50 value are appended to the pb50_data DataFrame.

Finally, the pb50_data DataFrame is sorted by date in ascending order, and the PB50 values over time are plotted using matplotlib.pyplot. The resulting plot provides a visual representation of the changes in PB50 values for the selected stocks within the specified time range.
